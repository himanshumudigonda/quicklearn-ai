# PWA Icons

For the PWA to work properly, you need to add these icon files to the `/frontend/public` directory:

1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192px icon
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512px icon

## Quick Way to Create Icons:

1. Go to https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
2. Create an icon with:
   - Text: "QL" (QuickLearn)
   - Background: Purple gradient (#7c3aed)
   - Text color: White
3. Download and rename the 192x192 and 512x512 files
4. Place them in `/frontend/public/`
